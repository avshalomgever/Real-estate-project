      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Avshalom Evgi, the founder of Get Home Now, has been involved in the real
        estate business for most of his life - in the UK and Israel, in the
        commercial and residential property. He has much experience in locating,
        renovating and managing investment property. Additionally,Avshalom
        jointly manages a vacation rental business in Jerusalem with his wife
        Maya.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get Home Now is the result of a concept that's been brewing in Avshalom's mind
        for several years, to enable properties on the market to become
        accessible and visible to all - buyers, sellers, renters, and brokers.
        The objective was to make the process of listing and finding the right
        property less of an insurmountable and hostile mission, but more of an
        everyday task.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal was to create an extremely user-friendly internet marketplace,
        initially serving the Israeli market, but with plans to expand further.
        The Israeli property market has a unique character, due to its inherent
        dynamism and vibrancy - fuelled by domestic demand and foreigners
        looking for a second home in the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
        Get Home Now' bilingual element is essential - allowing Hebrew and English
        speakers to interact, thereby generating further transparency- so that
        language would not form a barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together with his long-serving and suffering ! developer and advisor -
        Alon Pinukim - Avshalom hopes that Get Home Now will achieve its aims and
        ambitions, and change the way the way the Israeli property market works
        - for the better!
